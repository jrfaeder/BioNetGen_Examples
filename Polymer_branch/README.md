This simple polymer model demonstrates a couple of different ways to answer this question that was posted after the 2021 Cell Modeling Workshop about how to model breakup of a polymer chain:
`Hi all, my team mates and I are currently trying to model the depolymerization of a complex like this A(mol,top,bottom!1).A(mol,top!1,bottom!2).A(mol,top!2,bottom!3).A(mol,top!3,bottom!4).A(mol,top!4,bottom). A diffusing molecule in our model environment can bind to any molecule A (at component "mol") of the complex and cut the bond connecting either the top OR the bottom molecule A. We're wondering whether BNGL has any "OR" syntax that would allow a reactant to result in one of given possible products?`
